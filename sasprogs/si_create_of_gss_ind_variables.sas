DESCRIPTION: 

si_create_of_gss_ind_variables

Combines all the GSS person information across different waves into one single 
table. Only a limited set of variables which are useful for the outcomes framework project have 
been retained.

INPUT:
[&idi_version.].[gss_clean].[gss_person] = 2016 GSS person table
[&idi_version.].[gss_clean].[gss_person] = 2014 GSS person table
[&idi_version.].[gss_clean].[gss_person_2012] = 2012 GSS person table
[&idi_version.].[gss_clean].[gss_person_2010] = 2010 GSS person table
[&idi_version.].[gss_clean].[gss_person_2008] = 2008 GSS person table

OUTPUT:dep
sand.of_gss_ind_variables = dataset with person variables for GSS

NOTES:   
1. All GSS waves are available only from IDI_Clean_20171027 onwards.


HISTORY: 
22 Nov 2017 VB Converted the SQL version into SAS.
20 Dec 2017 WJ Added SQL part of income derived for OECD for benefits and OECD ISCED attempt and mental_health_type
10 Mar 2018 WJ Added Other GSS variables that were matched based on the waves and availability - Note that variables added have not yet been formatted
10 Apr 2018 WJ Added variables used for benefit to employment work
10 Jul 2018 WJ Added new housing variables requested by David Rea
20 Jul 2018 BV Added voting, free time and access to green space indicator
06 Aug 2018 WJ Changed the dsn variable and added variables requested about size of family for the pq
19 Oct 2018 WJ - Modified for 2016 refresh
27 Nov 2018 WJ - Modified specifically for Social Housing 3 in terms of creating new snz_uids which has better linkage and variables of interest for SH3
